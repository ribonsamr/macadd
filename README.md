### How to run it:
The script loads a file called `maclist.txt` from the same folder, write down the MAC addresses in the following format, each address separated by a new line:
`My iPhone, <mac_address>`

When you run the script using `python3.6 macadd.py`, you will be asked to enter an input, you can enter the MAC address directly, or copy multiple addresses and enter a single character of 'clipboard'.

eg. `Check mac address: c` or `Check mac address: clip`
